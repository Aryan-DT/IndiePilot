# 🚀 IndiePilot - Independence Copilot for Teens

**An offline, privacy-first independence copilot that empowers teens to build autonomy safely and positively.**

## 🌟 The Story

### The Problem
Teens today face a unique challenge: they're more connected than ever, but often lack the practical life skills and confidence needed for true independence. Traditional education focuses on academics but misses crucial real-world skills like budgeting, decision-making, and community building.

### The Solution
IndiePilot is a comprehensive, offline-first platform that gamifies independence building through:
- **Life Skills Quests** - Practical challenges that build real-world competence
- **Three-Jar Budgeting** - Teen-friendly financial literacy with visual feedback
- **Privacy-First Community** - Safe peer connections without personal data exposure
- **Scenario Simulations** - Risk-free practice for real-life decisions
- **Autonomy Index** - Personalized progress tracking across four key areas

### Why It's Unique
- **IndieGraph™** - The first skill dependency graph showing how life skills unlock each other
- **Share Codes** - Privacy-first community features using anonymous codes instead of personal info
- **Offline-First** - Works without internet, respects teen privacy and autonomy
- **Evidence-Based Scoring** - Autonomy Index with weighted metrics across Skills, Budgeting, Community, and Judgment

## 🧠 IndieGraph™ - Skill Dependency Engine

### How It Works
IndieGraph uses graph theory to map how life skills depend on and unlock each other:

```
Basic Laundry → Emergency Preparedness → First Aid
     ↓
Meal Planning → Grocery Shopping → Cooking Basics
     ↓
Time Management → Public Transport + Appointment Booking
     ↓
Budget Tracking → Financial Planning → Job Interview Skills
```

### Recommendation Algorithm
1. **Centrality Score** = Skills unlocked by this skill - Prerequisites needed
2. **Coverage Score** = Number of new skills that become available
3. **Combined Ranking** = Centrality + Coverage for optimal learning path

### Example Recommendations
- **High Centrality**: Time Management (unlocks 4+ skills)
- **High Coverage**: Budget Tracking (enables financial independence)
- **Balanced**: Meal Planning (practical + foundational)

## 📊 Autonomy Index Formula

The Autonomy Index (0-100) combines four weighted areas:

```
Autonomy Index = (Skills × 0.30) + (Budgeting × 0.30) + (Community × 0.15) + (Judgment × 0.25)
```

### Individual Scores
- **Skills** = min(100, completed_quests × 10)
- **Budgeting** = Financial health score + streak bonus - overspend penalty
- **Community** = min(100, posts_created×5 + posts_claimed×10)
- **Judgment** = Average of last 5 simulation scores (default 50)

### Radar Chart Visualization
Real-time radar chart shows progress across all four areas, helping teens understand their independence strengths and growth opportunities.
